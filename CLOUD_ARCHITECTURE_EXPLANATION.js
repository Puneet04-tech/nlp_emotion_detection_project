// ☁️ CLOUD-BASED SOLUTION FOR 24/7 OPERATION
// This ensures everything works even when your laptop is off

/* 
🌐 CURRENT SETUP ANALYSIS:

✅ WHAT WORKS 24/7 (Render Server):
- Data collection from global users
- Real-time storage in cloud
- Admin dashboard access
- Data export capabilities
- Health monitoring

❌ WHAT NEEDS LAPTOP (Current Limitation):
- Local file storage
- Automatic training
- Direct laptop access

🎯 SOLUTION: Complete Cloud Architecture

// 1. ☁️ CLOUD DATA FLOW (Works 24/7)
const CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE = {
  userInteraction: 'Friend uses voice → Netlify frontend',
  dataProcessing: 'Voice analysis → Emotion detection',
  cloudStorage: 'Data sent to → Render server (always running)',
  realTimeAccess: 'You access via → Admin dashboard anytime',
  dataDownload: 'Download all data → Export endpoint'
};

// 2. 📱 ACCESS YOUR DATA ANYTIME
const DATA_ACCESS_METHODS = {
  adminDashboard: 'https://nlp-emotion-detection-project.onrender.com/admin',
  exportAll: 'https://nlp-emotion-detection-project.onrender.com/api/data/export',
  liveAnalytics: 'https://nlp-emotion-detection-project.onrender.com/api/analytics/live',
  healthCheck: 'https://nlp-emotion-detection-project.onrender.com/api/health'
};

// 3. 🔄 AUTOMATED TRAINING SOLUTION
const TRAINING_ARCHITECTURE = {
  approach: 'Cloud-based periodic training',
  trigger: 'Every N new recordings or time-based',
  storage: 'Training models stored on Render server',
  access: 'Download trained models when needed'
};

// 4. 📧 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
const NOTIFICATION_METHODS = {
  email: 'Get email when new data arrives',
  discord: 'Discord webhook notifications',
  dashboard: 'Real-time admin dashboard',
  periodic: 'Daily/weekly summary reports'
};

// 5. 💾 DATA PERSISTENCE
const DATA_STORAGE = {
  location: 'Render server cloud storage',
  backup: 'Automatic cloud backups',
  access: '24/7 availability via API',
  download: 'Export anytime as JSON/CSV'
};

/* 
🎯 WHAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL EXPERIENCE:

1. Visit your Netlify link
2. Use voice emotion detection
3. Data flows to cloud server (works 24/7)
4. You get notifications
5. Access data anytime via dashboard

✅ NO LAPTOP REQUIRED FOR:
- Data collection
- Storage
- Real-time monitoring
- Data export
- Basic analytics

🔧 LAPTOP ONLY NEEDED FOR:
- Downloading collected data
- Advanced local analysis
- Model fine-tuning
