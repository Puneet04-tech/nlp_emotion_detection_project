## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Core Classes Enhanced:

#### `EmotionDetectionEngine`
- **New Methods**:
  - `calculateFeatureMatch()`: Advanced feature matching with tolerance
  - `analyzeKeywords()`: Enhanced keyword analysis with weighting
  - `analyzeEmotionalContext()`: Context-aware text analysis
  - `integrateBERTAnalysis()`: BERT integration and mapping
  - `calculateEnhancedConfidence()`: Multi-factor confidence calculation
  - `assessFeatureQuality()`: Audio feature quality assessment

#### `VoiceEmotionSystem` Component
- **Async Detection**: Updated to use async `detectEmotion()` method
- **Enhanced File Upload**: Improved error handling and status reporting
- **Live Analysis**: Real-time BERT integration for recording
- **UI Enhancements**: Enhanced emotion display with breakdown information

### Confidence Calculation Formula:
```
baseConfidence = (maxScore/100) * 0.6 + scoreConsistency * 0.4
finalConfidence = baseConfidence + transcriptBonus + bertBonus + qualityBonus - fileAnalysisPenalty
```

### BERT Integration Weights:
- **Audio Features**: 35% (pitch, volume, spectral, ZCR)
- **Text Analysis**: 40% (keywords, context)
- **BERT Analysis**: 25% (emotion classification, sentiment)

## ðŸ“Š Expected Improvements

### Confidence Accuracy:
- **Before**: Basic percentage-based confidence (often inaccurate)
- **After**: Multi-factor confidence with realistic 10-95% range

### Emotion Detection:
- **Before**: Audio + keyword matching only
- **After**: Audio + enhanced text analysis + BERT contextual understanding

### File Upload Analysis:
- **Before**: Limited audio feature extraction
- **After**: Enhanced audio analysis + BERT text processing + confidence weighting

### User Experience:
- **Before**: Basic emotion percentages
- **After**: Detailed breakdown, confidence levels, analysis method indicators

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

1. **Test BERT Integration**: Upload text/audio with clear emotional content
2. **Test Confidence Accuracy**: Compare confidence levels with actual emotion strength
3. **Test Fallback Scenarios**: Disable network to test BERT fallback
4. **Test Multi-Modal**: Compare analysis with audio-only vs. text-rich files
5. **Test Enhancement Indicators**: Verify UI shows correct analysis method

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

1. **Custom BERT Models**: Train domain-specific emotion models
2. **Emotion Intensity**: Add emotion intensity scoring beyond basic detection
3. **Multi-Language BERT**: Support for non-English emotion analysis
4. **Real-Time Learning**: Adaptive weights based on user feedback
5. **Emotion Transitions**: Track emotional changes over time
