Abstract:
1. Problem Definition
VoiceStudy addresses the challenge of accurately transcribing speech and simultaneously detecting emotion from voice recordings. The problem requires robust ASR in noisy, multi-speaker, and cross-accent conditions and fine-grained emotion classification that integrates acoustic and semantic cues.

2. Application
Applications include education (student study assistants, lecture summarization), mental health monitoring, customer service analytics, and human-computer interaction.

3. Gap (Challenges)/ Current trend in your problem domain
- Challenges: domain shift, limited labeled emotional datasets, speaker variability, low-resource languages, latency constraints for real-time processing.
- Trends: hybrid approaches combining acoustic features, transformer-based language models (BERT variants), end-to-end speech models (Whisper), and on-device inference for privacy.

4. Methods (Traditional and novel) based on literature done
- Traditional: feature-based classifiers using MFCCs, pitch, spectral features with SVM/Random Forest (e.g., Schuller et al., 2010).
- Modern/novel: Transformer-based ASR and speech representation models (e.g., Whisper by Radford et al., 2023), SSL models (wav2vec 2.0; Baevski et al., 2020) and BERT-like models for textual emotion inference (Devlin et al., 2019). Hybrid emotion detection combines acoustic classifiers with semantic features from transcribed text (Tzirakis et al., 2018).

5. Proposed approach
We propose a hybrid pipeline: robust audio preprocessing and resampling, local/offline ASR (Vosk) when available with a cloud STT fallback (Deepgram/Whisper API), acoustic feature extraction (RMS, ZCR, MFCC, pitch) followed by a neural fusion module that combines acoustic embeddings and contextual semantic embeddings produced by a BERT-based text encoder to produce per-utterance emotion scores.

6. Dataset used
We use a combination of publicly available datasets: IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, CREMA-D for acted emotional speech; a subset of Librispeech for ASR benchmarking; and in-house collected lecture audio samples for domain-specific evaluation.

7. Result and discussion
- Summarized results (placeholders): ASR WER on Librispeech subset: X%; emotion classification accuracy on IEMOCAP: Y%; F1-score on RAVDESS: Z%.
- Discussion: The hybrid fusion model improves emotion detection by N% relative to acoustic-only baselines and maintains reasonable latency for near-real-time use.

8. Conclusion
VoiceStudy demonstrates a practical, privacy-aware pipeline for speech transcription and emotion intelligence that leverages local models with cloud fallbacks and combines acoustic and semantic signals for improved emotion detection.

## I. Introduction

1. Problem Definition
Accurate, low-latency speech transcription and emotion detection are essential for interactive systems that support learning, summarization, and mental state monitoring. Existing solutions often excel in either ASR or emotion classification but rarely integrate both in a lightweight, deployable pipeline.

2. Application
- Lecture summarization for students.
- Automated emotional analytics for call centers.
- Clinical screening support for mood and affect disorders.

3. Gap (Challenges)/ Current trend in your problem domain
- Data scarcity for spontaneous emotional speech.
- Need for adaptable models across domains and languages.
- Privacy and latency trade-offs when using cloud STT vs local ASR.

5. Proposed approach
We merge acoustic and textual signals. The pipeline includes preprocessing (resampling to 16 kHz), local Vosk-based ASR where possible, or cloud STT fallback. Audio frames are analyzed for acoustics; transcribed text is encoded by a fine-tuned BERT model. A fusion network (concatenation + dense layers, or cross-attention) outputs emotion probabilities per utterance.

- IEMOCAP (Busso et al., 2008)
- RAVDESS (Livingstone & Russo, 2018)

## III. Proposed Method

a. Problem setting
We formalize the task as joint ASR + emotion classification. Given audio X, output transcript T and emotion label(s) E per utterance.

b. Framework overview
The pipeline consists of:
- Audio preprocessing (resample/normalize)
- ASR module (Vosk local or cloud STT)
- Acoustic feature extractor (RMS, ZCR, MFCC, pitch contours)
- Text encoder (BERT/fine-tuned)
- Fusion module (neural network combining acoustic and textual embeddings)
- Training center to collect labeled samples and fine-tune local weights

c. Algorithm
Pseudocode:
```
for audio_file in dataset:
  frames = preprocess(audio_file)
  transcript = ASR(frames)
  acoustic_feats = extract_acoustic_features(frames)
  text_embeddings = BERT.encode(transcript)
  fused = FusionNetwork(acoustic_feats, text_embeddings)
  predict emotion = Softmax(fused)
```

d. Proposed Architecture
- Acoustic encoder: 1D CNN / LSTM / small transformer producing acoustic embedding vector.
- Text encoder: pre-trained BERT (base), optionally fine-tuned on emotion-labeled transcripts.
- Fusion: concatenation followed by dense layers or cross-attention blocks.
